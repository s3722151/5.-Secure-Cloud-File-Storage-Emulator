# Project Journal

9/1/2025
Created the project with the requirements. 
Used this to diagnose issues of cloning github to eclipse. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPT7v69guVY&t=376s

10/1/2025
Imported the packages necessary to select a file.

11/1/2025
Created and experimented with the second method.
Decided to add to it by allowing a try catch statement, allowing more file extensions, adding a return.

12/1/2025
Moved method 1 to oldCode file. Edited method 2 so that it could just be executed as a method. 
In method 2 also included a else statement so that another prompt would appear if nothing is selected.

13/1/2025
Started progress on reading the file. 
I just need to figure out how to make a what user selected go into the method. 

14/1/2025 
Fixed the issue of making a variable call upon a method. 
- Defined it in main method. Then assigned it to method rather than defining it in method.
Fixed the issue with reading a file based on input.
- Rather than making a method, I placed the code in the main method, that way input could be read. 

15/1/2025
I just copied how I encrypted a a file using AES from a previous project :).
Plan to create the read and write tomorrow then next day finish project by 
making another class that can decrypt a file. 

16/1/2025
Created folder to store the encrypted files. 
Created the code to create file and write to file in cloud storage. 
Created a method(space) for spacing to make reading console easier.
Created the class "encryptFile" and "decryptFile" as name lines more of the function of the project.
Created a relative path for the creating and writing to the encrypted file.
Turns out I cannot make a new class and re-use code as the key to encrypt is not saved. 
I should find a way to save it or keep code in 1 class.

17/1/2025
Added decrypting mode. 
Problem is I am getting an error that input length must be a multiple of 16 when decrypting.

18/1/2025
Tried solutions online to solving padding issue. They did not work.

19/1/2025
Trying to resolve issues with memory pooling. That is because I did not properly close the reader object when reading.

21/1/2025
I am having having the following issue: 
	"Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class decryptFile
	java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: decryptFile (class file version 66.65535) was compiled with preview features that are unsupported. 
	This version of the Java Runtime only recognizes preview features for class file version 67.6553"
https://www.oracle.com/au/java/technologies/downloads/#java21
I have tried re-installing and changing the jdk. I think I need to to try using an older version, 23 to 21. 

22/1/2025
For now I installed a local repository on laptop. 
I am thinking of solution to make a new project but copy the code then go from there.

23/1/2025
I resolved the issue of linkage. Just downloaded JDK 21 and changed the filepath and properties.
Investing computerphile to understand AES. Reviewing code examples to revise.  

24/1/2025.
Light day. Just looking at some examples.

25/1/2025
Created a new file "wayOneEncryption". 
This would be a simple way of encrypting the file however you do NOT select file size (e.g. 128, 258).
Through this, I realised the error of "encryptFile". Turns out I had read the contents but encrypted the fileName, not the contents itself :).
Also that when encrypting only some parts of the file are encrypted, the second line. 
- The issue may draw from .hasNextLine.

26/1/2025
Today I am looking at potential ways how I could parse to a variable (parsing)
I am also looking at the arrays and arraylist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbYgm0r7u6o.

27/1/2025

- This directs a scanner to read things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfSOICxcyzA
-  Make a variable equal to all lines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmMCUSMQuag
- This has a way to count number of lines (int numTmimes)

28/1/2025
Light day.

Way to make multilines into 1 variable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iItTEl9d-aI

31/1/2025
Continuing on listArrays. Instead of reading line by line, you can read all lines.
https://medium.com/@AlexanderObregon/javas-files-readalllines-method-explained-14312314c1c4#:~:text=readAllLines()%20is%20its%20simplicity,older%20methods%20such%20as%20BufferedReader%20
I would then need to adapt this in wayOneEncryption file.
This could then be used as confirmation all lines are read but stored together in contrast to the last line.
After playing around in the wayOneEncryption file. 
I was successfully able to read all lines, store it ina listArray and call upon it multilple times. 
Now I just need to encrypt it. 
If successful, I just need to worry about finding the right encryption. 

2/2/2025
I learnt that you cannot just encode a listString the same way a string is done in wayOneEncryption file.

3/2/2025
I followed this guide: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27962116/simplest-way-to-encrypt-a-text-file-in-java
This was an alternate way of encrypting using DES (file is "methodDES").
Useful source - Reading Text Files using an ArrayList: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6_zAtrWl8o
Further resource suggests using a stringbuilder to add text from an array: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/599161/best-way-to-convert-an-arraylist-to-a-string

5/2/2025
This was my final research and attempt before deadline.
Going to try doing this in methodDES file.
Step 1 read a file into an array (Use Way 3)
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/read-file-into-an-array-in-java/
Step 2: Turn the array into a string 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-convert-an-array-to-string-in-java/
Step 3: Encrypt
 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/encrypt-and-decrypt-string-file-using-java/
Step 4: Turn the string back into an array
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/convert-a-string-to-character-array-in-java/

6/2/2025
Had time to try the above. It works.
Now I just need to find a way for it to print it at each line

Final Thoughts 
- I learnt how to manually select a file and use it. 
- I learnt the difference between bufferedReader(faster) vs. scanners.
- I was exposed listArrays.
- I think I lost motivation towards to the end. That was a mix of being stuck but being tired from work.
