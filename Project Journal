# Project Journal

9/1/2025
Created the project with the requirements. 
Used this to diagnose issues of cloning github to eclipse. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPT7v69guVY&t=376s

10/1/2025
Imported the packages necessary to select a file.

11/1/2025
Created and experimented with the second method.
Decided to add to it by allowing a try catch statement, allowing more file extensions, adding a return.

12/1/2025
Moved method 1 to oldCode file. Edited method 2 so that it could just be executed as a method. 
In method 2 also included a else statement so that another prompt would appear if nothing is selected.

13/1/2025
Started progress on reading the file. 
I just need to figure out how to make a what user selected go into the method. 

14/1/2025 
Fixed the issue of making a variable call upon a method. 
- Defined it in main method. Then assigned it to method rather than defining it in method.
Fixed the issue with reading a file based on input.
- Rather than making a method, I placed the code in the main method, that way input could be read.

I just copied how I encrypted a a file using AES from a previous project :).
Plan to create the read and write tomorrow then next day finish project by 
making another class that can decrypt a file. 

16/1/2025
Created folder to store the encrypted files. 
Created the code to create file and write to file in cloud storage. 
Created a method(space) for spacing to make reading console easier.
Created the class "encryptFile" and "decryptFile" as name lines more of the function of the project.
Created a relative path for the creating and writing to the encrypted file.
Turns out I cannot make a new class and re-use code as the key to encrypt is not saved. 
I should find a way to save it or keep code in 1 class.

17/1/2025
Added decrypting mode. 
Problem is I am getting an error that input length must be a multiple of 16 when decrypting.

18/1/2025
Tried solutions online to solving padding issue. They did not work.

19/1/2025
Trying to resolve issues with memory pooling. That is because I did not properly close the reader object when reading.

21/1/2025
I am having having the following issue: 
	"Error: LinkageError occurred while loading main class decryptFile
	java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: decryptFile (class file version 66.65535) was compiled with preview features that are unsupported. 
	This version of the Java Runtime only recognizes preview features for class file version 67.6553"

I have tried re-installing and changing the jdk. I think I need to to try using an older version, 23 to 21. 

22/1/2025
For now I installed a local repository on laptop. 
I am thinking of solution to make a new project but copy the code then go from there.

23/1/2025
I resolved the issue of linkage. Just downloaded JDK 21 and changed the filepath and properties.
Investing computerphile to understand AES. Reviewing code examples to revise.  

24/1/2025.
Light day. Just looking at some examples.

25/1/2025
Created a new file "wayOneEncryption". 
This would be a simple way of encrypting the file however you do NOT select file size (e.g. 128, 258).
Through this, I realised the error of "encryptFile". Turns out I had read the contents but encrypted the fileName, not the contents itself :).
Also that when encrypting only some parts of the file are encrypted, the second line. 
- The issue may draw from .hasNextLine.

26/1/2025
Today I am looking at potential ways how I could parse to a variable (parsing)
I am also looking at the arrays and arraylist https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbYgm0r7u6o.

- This directs a scanner to read things
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfSOICxcyzA
-  Make a variable equal to all lines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmMCUSMQuag
- This has a way to count number of lines (int numTmimes)
