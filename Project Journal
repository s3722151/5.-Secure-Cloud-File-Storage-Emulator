Imported the packages necessary to select a file.

Created and experimented with the second method.
Decided to add to it by allowing a try catch statement, allowing more file extensions, adding a return.

Moved method 1 to oldCode file. Edited method 2 so that it could just be executed as a method. 
In method 2 also included a else statement so that another prompt would appear if nothing is selected.
