Created the project with the requirements. 
Used this to diagnose issues of cloning github to eclipse. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPT7v69guVY&t=376s

Imported the packages necessary to select a file.

11/1/2025
Created and experimented with the second method.
Decided to add to it by allowing a try catch statement, allowing more file extensions, adding a return.

12/1/2025
Moved method 1 to oldCode file. Edited method 2 so that it could just be executed as a method. 
In method 2 also included a else statement so that another prompt would appear if nothing is selected.

13/1/2025
Started progress on reading the file. 
I just need to figure out how to make a what user selected go into the method.

Fixed the issue of making a variable call upon a method. 
- Defined it in main method. Then assigned it to method rather than defining it in method.
Fixed the issue with reading a file based on input.
- Rather than making a method, I placed the code in the main method, that way input could be read.

I just copied how I encrypted a a file using AES from a previous project :).
Plan to create the read and write tomorrow then next day finish project by 
making another class that can decrypt a file.
